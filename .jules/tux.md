## 2023-10-27 - Enhance CI/CD Type Checking for SDK

**Learning:** The project relies on pnpm workspaces, and default tsc checks from the root may overlook subpackages if tsconfig is not properly mapped. Also, test states (like local `queue/` files) must be strictly cleaned up to avoid polluting pull requests.
**Action:** When adding CI checks for a specific workspace package, use the `pnpm --filter <package-name>` syntax. Always ensure `git clean -fd` or similar checks are made to prevent stray mock test artifacts from being committed.
